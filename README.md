# Solidity Smart Contracts: Joint Savings Account Example
This repo features a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ETH management functions to implement a fictitious financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
